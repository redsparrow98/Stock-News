In order for this app to be correct it would need to get the data for the past 2 days any time its run. Therefore it
cant use the hard coded keys in the stock_daya which would be specific dates (e.g. 2024-06-14)

    - To work around this the program creates a new list from the stock_data using list comprehension selecting only the 
    values which will hold all nested dictionary with keys for each significant point of the day. 
    (open, high, low, close, volume) and the price at that point of the day as the value
    
    - To select yesterday's closing stock price it just need to access the first item in the list '0' and the '4. close' 
    key which will retrieve the value of the stock at market close point.
    
    - To select day before yesterday's closing stock price it just need to access the second item in the list '1' and 
    the '4. close' key which will retrieve the value of the stock at market close point.
